This repository introduces the unsupervised learning technique PCA. Unsupervised learning methods are models/ techniques that differ from regression and classification, where the latter are concerned with answering/predicting answers to questions like how much or what kind, Unsurpervised learning models/ techniques are concerned, not with answering a specific question but identifying patterns in data without regard to labels or values that models are pre-trained on. Unsupervised methods can broadly be broken down into two camps: Clustering techniques which sort data into subgroups and Dimensionality reduction techniques which compress data along areas where most information is found, a very useful technique particularly on very large datasets or data sets with large numbers of features/predictors. Here we discuss PCA, a dimensionality reduction technique.

2. Then clone your fork down to your local computer (this will copy your fork onto to your local machine)

```
git clone https://github.com/[yourusername]/dsc-Deloitte-072423.git
```

3. Add the ```/flatiron-school/``` version as the upstream (to pull future changes JP makes into your own copy)

4. You can make changes to the notebooks now! Remember to push your changes to your forked version of the repo (to save your local changes online):
```

**Whenever you want to get updated notes:**
  
5. Grab the changes from the upstream repo
 ```
git fetch upstream
```  
6. Merge new changes onto your local repo

For example, you might write a message like "incorporating newest changes/updates from upstream".
